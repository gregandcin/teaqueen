# WIP: This board is still being designed!

# TeaQueen
An Alice Inspired Split Keyboard

## About the TeaQueen

The TeaQueen is a split, Alice keyboard running QMK firmware, with VIA and Vial compatibility (firmware to be realeased later). Based off of the [Red Queen](https://github.com/dbostian/redqueen) by [Dan Bostian](https://github.com/dbostian). 

V1 of the board, aka the Scuffed Edition, uses Kailh Hotswap sockets and Pro Micro compatitble dev boards, with a focus on [RP2040 Community Edition boards](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/platformdev_rp2040?id=rp2040_ce) such as the Elite-Pi.

## Why?

A PCB made by a factory is easier to assemble than handwiring.

## Want to make modifications?
This PCB uses the [Kiswitch](https://github.com/kiswitch/kiswitch) library as a globally installed pluggin in KiCad 7, so make sure to install that if you want to properly. Otherwise, everything is there for you as local libraries.

## Future Editions
A list of potential TODOs:

- [ ] Regular Solder socket boards
- [ ] An integrated RP2040 MCU
- [ ] A wireless edition
